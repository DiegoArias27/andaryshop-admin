// `vite preview` (what this used to run on Railway) is explicitly not meant
// for production use — among other things, it doesn't let us set different
// cache rules for index.html vs the hashed /assets files, which is exactly
// what caused today's bug: a browser kept its OLD cached index.html (from a
// previous deploy) after a new deploy replaced dist/ entirely, so it asked
// for a CSS file whose hash no longer existed — the request fell through to
// index.html (SPA-fallback for client-side routing) and the browser
// rejected text/html where it expected a stylesheet, so NO styles loaded at
// all. index.html must always be revalidated; the hashed asset files never
// change without their filename also changing, so they're safe to cache
// aggressively and permanently.
